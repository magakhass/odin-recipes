    <h1>Granny's Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="images/lasagna.png" alt="Lasagna" style="width: 500px;">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This 3-cheese lasagna is the <i>ultimate</i> comfort food, and the ingredients are refrigerator and pantry staples. See the recipe card below for exact quantities.</p>
    <h5>
         * This is my granny's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. <br />
         A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my granny's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. <br />
         I have found none better anywhere.
         Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li><b>Ground beef</b> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.</li>
        <li><b>Onion</b> – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li><b>Garlic cloves</b> – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
        <li><b>Red wine</b> – This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or stock.</li>
        <li><b>Marinara sauce</b> – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
        <li><b>Dried thyme</b> – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li><b>Secret ingredient</b> – no idea what it is, she says it's 'love'? You may substitute it with hatred, which is more affordable. Or nutmeg.</li>
        <li><b>Parsley</b> – flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles</b> – Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
        <li><b>Cottage cheese</b> – adds great texture and moisture.</li>
        <li><b>Ricotta cheese</b> – we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
        <li><b>Mozzarella cheese</b> – An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
        <li><b>Egg</b> – helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
    </ul>

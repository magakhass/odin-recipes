    <img src="images/sandvich.jpg" alt="Heavy eating sandvich">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Sandvich can be consumed by pressing either primary fire or taunt key (default keys: MOUSE1 and G, respectively). <br />When eaten, it gradually replenishes up to 300 health over a four second duration with no overheal. <br />While the Heavy is eating, <i>he makes a loud munching sound and the player is forced into the third-person view.</i> <br />As eating the Sandvich is considered a taunt, it cannot be consumed in instances when taunts cannot be used, such as when underwater.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li><b>White bread</b> - two slices, no more and no less. Make sure it won't eat you.</li>
